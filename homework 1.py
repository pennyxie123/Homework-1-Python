# Go to the syllabus and read the section on Academic Integrity before doing this assignment.
# Please write your code in the space below each question, and make sure that your code runs.
# Read the questions carefully and present the results in the format asked (e.g. print statements)
# If a method is specified, you must use that method to get the result even if you find/know of
# another way to do it.

# Question 1: The Pythagorean theorem says that the sides of a right triangle follow the formula:
# a squared + b squared = c squared
# where c is the hypotenuse. Write code that takes in the variables a and b, then prints out the
# length of the hyptenuse, the area of the triangle (one half base times height) and the perimeter
# (the sum of all three sides)



# Question 2: For any given rectangle, the area is simply its base times its height, and its perimeter
# is the sum of all four sides. Create a dictionary where the keys are a, b, area, and permieter. Fill
# in any values for a and b, and have the dictionary values for area and permiter calculated.



# Question 3: A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same both forwards and backwards. Write code
# that takes a variable of any string, then tests to see whether it qualifies as a palindrome. Make sure
# it works on the word "radar" and the phrase "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", while rejecting the
# word "Apple" and the phrase "This isn't a palindrome". Print the result.



# Question 4: Using a for loop, write code that takes in any list of objects, then prints out:
# "The value at position __ is __."
# for every element in the loop, where the first blank is the index location and the second blank is
# the object at that index location.



# Question 5: Create a list containing the values 10, 2, 3, 3, and 5, in that order. Then, using a list
# comprehension, reverse the list and add each element together with the value at the same position in the
# original list. For example, if a list contains 1 and 3, the reversed version contains 3 and 1. Then
# summing the first elements gives you 1+3=4, and the second elements gives you 3+1=4, for a final list of
# 4 and 4. Finally, remove duplicate values and print the result.
